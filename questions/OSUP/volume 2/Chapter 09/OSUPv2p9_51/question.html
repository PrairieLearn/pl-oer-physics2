A resistor rated at ${{params.R}}\rm\ k\Omega$ is connected across two batteries (each ${{params.V}}\rm\ V$) in series, with a total voltage of ${{params.Vtotal}}\rm\ V$.
The manufacturer advertises that their resistors are within ${{params.p}}\rm\ \%$ of the rated value.
What are the possible minimum current and maximum current through the resistor?  Give your answer in units of $\rm \mu A$.
