	<markdown>A more sustainable alternative to CFL bulbs and incandescent bulbs are light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs.
A $100\rm\ W$ incandescent bulb can be replaced by a $16\rm\ W$ LED bulb. Both produce $1600\rm\ lumens$ of light.

Assuming the cost of electricity is $\rm\ {$}{{params.c}}\textrm{ per kilowatt-hour}$, how much does it cost to run the LED bulb for one year if it runs for, on average, ${{params.h}}\textrm{ hours per day}$?
